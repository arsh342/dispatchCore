# dispatchCore

A real-time last-mile logistics control platform that brings order to the chaos of local delivery operations.

## The Problem

Last-mile delivery — the final leg from a local hub to the customer's door — is the most expensive and disorganized part of any logistics chain. It accounts for over half of total shipping costs, yet most small and mid-sized courier companies still coordinate their entire operation through phone calls, WhatsApp groups, and guesswork.

The consequences are real:

- **Drivers sit idle** while unassigned orders pile up nearby.
- **Orders get double-assigned**, sending two drivers to the same pickup.
- **Customers have no visibility** into where their package actually is.
- **Dispatchers operate blind**, making decisions without real-time data.
- **No performance tracking** means inefficiencies go unnoticed and unresolved.

Large enterprises build internal control towers to solve this. Small businesses can't afford to. They're left with chaos.

## What dispatchCore Does

dispatchCore replaces the manual, fragmented dispatch process with a single, synchronized platform where dispatchers, drivers, and customers all operate from the same real-time source of truth.

### For Dispatchers
A live control dashboard where they can see every driver, every order, and every delivery status — all updating in real time. Dispatchers can assign deliveries directly to their employed drivers or list orders on a public marketplace for independent drivers to pick up.

### For Employed Drivers
A clean, focused interface showing their assigned delivery queue, navigation, and simple status controls. They stay connected to their company's dispatch system at all times.

### For Independent Drivers
A gig-economy marketplace where freelance drivers can browse available deliveries, bid on the ones that match their route, and even pre-register their upcoming travel plans so dispatchers can proactively match them with packages heading the same direction.

### For Customers
A live tracking page — no login required — showing exactly where their package is and when it will arrive.

### For Platform Administrators
Full oversight of the entire system, managing companies, resolving disputes, and monitoring platform-wide health.

## Why This Matters

Every missed delivery window, every wasted trip, every idle driver hour directly cuts into a courier company's razor-thin margins. dispatchCore exists to turn reactive, manual operations into a coordinated, data-driven system — giving small logistics businesses the same operational intelligence that only large enterprises could previously afford.

## Built for Multiple Companies

dispatchCore is a multi-tenant platform. Each delivery company that signs up gets their own isolated workspace. Company A cannot see Company B's warehouses, drivers, orders, or analytics — and vice versa.

However, independent drivers are shared across the entire platform. When any company lists a delivery on the marketplace, freelance drivers from across dispatchCore can see it and bid. Once an independent driver picks up a delivery, only that specific company's dispatchers and the end customer can track them.

A platform-level administrator has full visibility across all companies to manage the system, onboard new businesses, and resolve disputes.

## Who Is This For


- Local and regional courier companies
- Last-mile delivery startups
- Businesses that rely on both full-time and freelance drivers
- Any delivery operation that has outgrown spreadsheets and WhatsApp coordination

## The Vision

dispatchCore is designed to grow. The foundation being built today is architected to support future capabilities like AI-powered route optimization, demand forecasting, predictive driver scheduling, and automated dispatch — transforming it from a coordination tool into an intelligent logistics engine.
